bio: Aaron is somebody who is a weird thinker. A human in perpetual progress. While he tries to understand the middle, he fails miserably and finds himself on either extreme sides of a spectrum. Self aware, modern, creative and self expressive, Aaron does best when he has the space to say whatever he likes. Highly opinionated and can contribute valuable criticism to help push any concept, project or idea forward.
